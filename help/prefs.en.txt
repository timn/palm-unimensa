In this window you can define the behavior on startup of UniMensa.
It can either show the current menu of the mensa that was shown last
when the program was closed the last time ("Save last mensa") or
it will always show a defined default mensa that you specify in the
list ("Always default mensa"). If you disable both options a
database defined default mensa will be shown on startup.
