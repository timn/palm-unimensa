Uni Mensa - Database Generator genUMENpdb
==============================================================================

** Introduction
*
This files are example code on how to create databases for UniMensa.

** Prerequisits
*
It depends on how much code you can reuse from what I wrote for your
university.
If you use most of the code you will need the following Perl modules:
HTML::TreeBuilder (which needs HTML::Parser)
Date::Calc
HTTP::Lite

If you want to use senddb.pl to send the database to an email address
(of an mailinglist for example) then you will also need the following
modules:
MIME::Lite
Net::SMTP
And an SMTP server that you can send through

** The generated files - or: How to generate own DBs
*
If you use my scripts then getmensa.pl will get the webpage with a POST HTTP
request. It will write it to mensa.raw.
parsemensa.pl will then open this file and extract the needed information.
It will generate an easy to parse file called mensa.pre. See the comment at
the top of parsemensa.pl about the format of this file.
Of course you can do this in one script but I wanted to keep scripts clean
and easy so I split them up.
genUMENpdb then finally creates the database. I do not (yet) publish the
source code since it looks pretty bad and I want to get that distance.
genUMENpdb is in many ways pretty bad coded. It needs to read from
mensa.pre, the file MUST be named that way and it MUST be in the cwd.
It will create a file called unimensa.pdb if mensa.pre had correct syntax.
Make sure that you have at most 16 mensas. Each mensa MUST have 6 lines
of entries. Each one representing one day. They may be no longer than
2047 chars. If you put :: somewhere into the string it is replaced by the
generator with \n\n (two linefeeds). This can be used to represent
the <br> in HTML output.

Note: maybe you have direct access for example to the database that the plans
are stored in. Than you do not need all that parsing stuff but you can create
mensa.pre directly from that data! It is just the way I need it.

If you have problems try the --debug flag for genUMENpdb, it generates some
output that may be helpful.

Hope someone will find that useful and create own PDBs. Please drop me a not
and I will put the download URL of your database to my page.
I plan to make the generation more comfortable by adding more flags
and opening the code. A on-thy-fly generator on the webpage or via SOAP
would also be an idea...
But first I need some users. If you are a user and if you _can code_ and want
to generate databases for your university then contact if you have problems.
Please no newbie questions. If you cannot code learn it and ask afterwards.
